# Project Title

My personal learning and notes of TypeScript

## Getting Started

These are the notes that i am creating in my TypeScript learning, the basis of my first approach with TypeScript is based on this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-typescript/ 

But I will give it my own order and structure and gather knowledge about the topics from various sources like TypeScript's own documentation for example or I will simply write the notes in my own style and according to my own criteria of how it is easier to learn certain topics. 

### Prerequisites

You only need have:
- NodeJs
- npm (Usually if you have node you have npm)
- TypeScript

### Installing

Download Node from their website: https://nodejs.org/en/

Install TypeScript
```
npm install -g typescript
```

Check node installation
```
node -v
```

Check TypeScript installation
```
node -v
```

Clone the repo: 
```
git clone [url]
```

And that's all! 

## Running the tests

For now there are no automatic tests available

### Break down into end to end tests

No test for now

### And coding style tests

Just use TypeScrit code!

## Deployment

No deployment required

## Built With

* [NodeJs](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - JavaScript Runtime Environment
* [TypeScript](https://maven.apache.org/) - Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.
